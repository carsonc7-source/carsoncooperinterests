    <p>Some of my favorite things about Rocket League include: </p>
    
    <ul> <!-- changed to list in the tutorial -->
      <li>The competitivness</li>
      <li>The fast paced gameplay</li>
      <li>The community</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The skill expression of the game keeps me coming back, and I would recommend anyone to give it a try.</p>
